This project is an item tracker, itended to show order frequency of one or many items, and frequency of histograms.
I feel as though this applications reads and writes well, but where it shines is the robustness, its easy to modify while also being simple to understand.
I would fix the issue of an incorrect input on the first page creating a loop error. No points were deducted for this however.
I found inputting wrong inputs to be the most difficult, say pickles wasnt on the query, but it was searched. The program would fail a lot during these moments.
This project would be useful for a multiplitude of other work such as stock managment, and other inventory jobs.
This program was made maintainable by having as few places of error as possible removal of "fluff" if you will, It has inline explanations of what each coding "brick"/"block" does, while having the ability to be applied to other files for versatility.
